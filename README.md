= Visma

This is a Ruby on Rails [Engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) for integrating with [Visma Global](https://www.visma.no/programvare/okonomi/visma-global/overview/)

= Dependencies

The v0.2 series of this gem depends on rails 4.1 and activerecord-sqlserver-adapter 4.1 series.

The reason is the sqlserver dependency supporting Microsoft SQL Server 2008.

If you want newer SQL Server support (and Ruby on Rails 5), you need a higher version of this gem.
